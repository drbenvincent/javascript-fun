        <p>I was really impressed with the <a
                href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/">Corona virus simulations</a>
            which appeared in The Washington Post recently. So much so that it inspired me to learn JavaScript. So this
            is my
            first attempt at learning html, css, and JavaScript.</p>

        <p>This implements a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model in a small finite population of agents moving
            about at random. All agents (apart from patient zero) starts off susceptible. An agent will get infected if
            they come into contact with an infected agent.</p>

        <p>For fun and educational purposes only. Do not make any life decisions based upon this simulation. Code is
            available on my <a href="https://github.com/drbenvincent/javascript-fun">GitHub</a>. </p>
